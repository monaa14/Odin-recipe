  <p> a warm dish</p>  
  <p>Ingredients  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
<li> ▢ 1/2 medium onion chopped </li>
<li> ▢ 1 (28 fluid ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
<li> ▢ 1 (10 fluid ounce) can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies with juices </li>
<li>▢ 1 cup chicken broth </li>
<li> ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>▢ 1 teaspoon smoked paprika </li>
<li> ▢ 1/2 tablespoon chili powder </li>
<li>▢ 1 (12 fluid ounce) can corn drained </li>
<li>▢ 1 (14 fluid ounce) can black beans drained & rinsed </li>
<li>▢ 1 cup heavy/whipping cream </li>
<li>▢ 2 cups cooked chicken (I used a rotisserie chicken) </li>
<li>▢ Salt & pepper to taste </li>
<li>▢ Toppings (optional, to taste): tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream, Tex-Mex cheese,</li> 
  </ul>
  <ol> 
    <li>Add the oil and onion to a soup pot and sauté over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes or until it's lightly browned.
        <li> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, Rotel, and chicken broth, followed by the garlic powder, smoked paprika, chili powder, corn, and black beans. Stir well and increase the heat to high.</li>
      <li> Once the soup has come to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer with the pot covered (lid slightly ajar) for 5 minutes.</li> 
     <li> Meanwhile, prep the toppings.</li> 
      <li> Stir in the cream and chicken and let it warm through for 3-5 minutes. Taste and season with salt & pepper as needed (I am generous with both).</li> 
      <li> Serve immediately and top bowls as desired.</li>
  </ol>
