    <p> A delicious and hardy dish 
  </p>
  <p>  Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 sticks celery chopped finely</li>
              <li> ▢ 2 medium carrots peeled & chopped finely </li>
               <li>▢ 1/2 medium onion chopped</li> 
               <li> ▢ 1 tablespoon butter</li> 
               <li>  ▢ 1 tablespoon butter</li> 
             <li>   ▢ 3 cloves garlic minced </li>
              <li> ▢ 2 tablespoons flour  </li> 
              <li> ▢ 6 cups chicken broth</li> 
               <li> 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li> 
               <li>  ▢ 1.5 pounds uncooked chicken breasts</li>
              <li> ▢ 1 cup uncooked orzo </li> 
               <li> ▢ 1 tablespoon lemon juice or to taste</li> 
              <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley or to taste </li>  
             <li> ▢ Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
     <ol>
       <li> Sauté the celery, carrots, and onions in a large soup pot with the butter and oil over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes.</li> 
    <li> Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the flour and cook for another minute or so.</li>
<li> Pour in the chicken broth and stir until the flour has dissolved, then add the Italian seasoning and chicken. Bring the soup to a boil.</li>
<li> over the soup (lid slightly open), and reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>l
<li>Stir in the orzo and cook for another 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through. I keep the lid off and stir it fairly often because it tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>Take the chicken out of the pot and cut it up, then add it back in. Add the lemon juice (you may want to add more than I suggest – I didn't want to make the soup too lemony for some people), parsley, and season the soup with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.</li>
     </ol>
